# AQUA-diagnostics

AQUA-diagnostics contains the full set of diagnostic tools developed for the Destination Earth Adaptation Climate Digital Twin (ClimateDT). It is designed to be used together with the [AQUA core framework](https://github.com/DestinE-Climate-DT/AQUA), which provides data access and preprocessing functionalities.

This repository includes only the scientific tools configured as diagnostics to run for online monitoring of climate simulations. Diagnostics can be executed standalone via the Python API, or through the `aqua analysis` wrapper provided by AQUA-core.

## Requirements

- Python `>=3.10,<3.13`
- A working installation of [AQUA-core](https://github.com/DestinE-Climate-DT/AQUA)
- A conda/mamba environment using packages from `conda-forge`

---

## Installation

### 1. Install AQUA-core

Follow the installation instructions in the AQUA-core repository:

> 📘 https://github.com/DestinE-Climate-DT/AQUA

### 2. Install AQUA-diagnostics
```bash
git clone git@github.com:DestinE-Climate-DT/AQUA-diagnostics.git
cd AQUA-diagnostics
mamba env create -f environment.yml
mamba activate aqua-diagnostics
pip install -e .
```

Next step is to install the [AQUA auxiliary files](https://aqua.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#auxiliary-files-installation) as:
```bash
aqua install <machine>
```

Final step is to add [AQUA catalogs](https://aqua.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#catalog-installation)
```bash
aqua add <catalog>
```
For example, to add the catalog for `climatedt-phase1`, run:
```bash
aqua add climatedt-phase1
```

> **Note:** The AQUA-core is installed via pypi dependency. AQUA-core can also be installed in an editable mode.
