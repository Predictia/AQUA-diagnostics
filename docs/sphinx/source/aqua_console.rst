The AQUA console
================

What is the AQUA console?
-------------------------

The AQUA console (introduced since v0.9.0) has two main purposes:

- A central access to manage where the configuration and catalog files are stored has been added. This can also handle fixes and grids files.
- A tool for more complex operations:

    - DROP (see :ref:`aqua-drop` and :ref:`drop`) 
    - FDB catalog generator (see :ref:`catalog_generator`).
    - Diagnostics wrapper for a complete experiment analysis (see :ref:`aqua_analysis`).

Here we give a brief overview of the features.
If you are a developer, you may want to read the :ref:`dev-notes` section.

The entry point for the console is the command ``aqua``.
It has the following subcommands:

- :ref:`aqua-install`
- :ref:`aqua-avail`
- :ref:`aqua-add`
- :ref:`aqua-remove`
- :ref:`aqua-set`
- :ref:`aqua-uninstall`
- :ref:`aqua-list`
- :ref:`aqua-update`
- :ref:`aqua-fixes`
- :ref:`aqua-grids`
- :ref:`aqua-drop`
- :ref:`aqua-analysis`

The main command has some options listed below:

.. option:: --version

    To show the AQUA version.

.. option:: --path

    To show the path where the source code is installed.
    This is particularly useful if you're running a script that uses AQUA.

.. warning::
    Some of the CLI commands (see :ref:`cli`) are still relying on the existance
    of an environment variable ``AQUA`` pointing to the main AQUA folder.
    This is deprecated in favor of the new console command.

.. option:: --help, -h

    To show the help message.

It is possible to set the level of verbosity with two options:

.. option:: --verbose, -v

    It increases the verbosity level, setting it to INFO.

.. option:: --very-verbose, -vv

    It increases the verbosity level, setting it to DEBUG.

In both cases the level of verbosity has to be specified before the subcommand.

.. _aqua-install:

aqua install
------------

With this command the configuration file and the default data models, grids and fixes are copied to the destination folder.
By default, this will be ``$HOME/.aqua``. It is possible to specify from where to copy and where to store.
It is also possible to ask for an editable installation, so that only links are created, ideal for developers, 
which can keep their catalog or fixes files under version control.

.. note::
    Since version ``v0.10`` the configuration file provided in the AQUA release is a template.
    Even if the ``aqua install`` is done in editable mode, the configuration file will be copied to the destination folder.

Mandatory arguments are:

.. option:: machine-name

    The name of the machine where you are installing. **It is a mandatory argument.**
    Even if you are working on your local machine, always define it (even a random name would suffice!)
    Setting machine to `lumi`, `levante` or `MN5` is fundamental to use AQUA on these platforms.

Optional arguments are:

.. option:: --path, -p <path>

    The folder where the configuration file is copied to. Default is ``$HOME/.aqua``.
    If this option is used, the tool will ask the user if they want a link in the default folder ``$HOME/.aqua``.
    If this link is not created, the environment variable ``AQUA_CONFIG`` has to be set to the folder specified.

.. option:: --editable, -e <path>

    It installs the configuration file from the path given.
    It will create a symbolic link to the configuration folder.
    This is very recommended for developers. Please read the :ref:`dev-notes` section.

.. warning::
    The editable mode requires a path to the ``AQUA/config`` folder, not to the main AQUA folder.

In addition to the general configuration file, ``aqua install`` supports copying and linking configuration files 
for different diagnostics.
Each diagnostic has its own set of configuration files that are copied or linked to specific folders.

After running ``aqua install``, the configuration files for each diagnostic will be organized in the target directories 
specified in the ``AQUA/src/aqua/cli/diagnostic_config.py``. For example, the structure might look like this:

.. code-block:: text

    $HOME/.aqua/
        ├── diagnostics/
        │   ├── atmglobalmean/
        │   │   └── cli/
        │   │       └── atm_mean_bias_config.yaml
        │   ├── ecmean/
        │   │   ├── config/
        │   │   │   ├── ecmean_config_destine-v1-levante.yml
        │   │   │   ├── ecmean_config_destine-v1.yml
        │   │   │   ├── interface_AQUA_destine-v1.yml
        │   │   └── cli/
        │   │       └── config_ecmean_cli.yaml

This structure ensures that all configuration files are neatly organized and easily accessible for each diagnostic type.

.. note::
    The configuration files for each diagnostic will be copied or linked with the same philosophy as the general configuration files.

.. _aqua-avail:

aqua avail
----------

This simple command will print all the available catalogs on a repository.
By default this will be the `Climate-DT-catalog <https://github.com/DestinE-Climate-DT/Climate-DT-catalog>`_.

.. option:: -r, --repository <user/repo>

    It is possible to specify a different repository to explore.
    The format is ``user/repo``. For example, ``DestinE-Climate-DT/Climate-DT-catalog``.
    If this option is not specified, the default repository will be used.

.. _aqua-add:

aqua add <catalog>
------------------

This command adds a catalog to the list of available catalogs.
It will copy the catalog folder and files to the destination folder.
As before, it is possible to specify if symbolic links have to be created
and it is possible to install extra catalogs not present in the AQUA release.

.. note::
    Since version ``v0.10`` the catalog is detached from the AQUA repository and
    it is available `here <https://github.com/DestinE-Climate-DT/Climate-DT-catalog>`_.

Multiple catalogs can be installed with multiple calls to ``aqua add``.
By default the catalog will be downloaded from the external Climate-DT catalog repository,
if a matching catalog is found. It is possible to specify a different repository.
As shown below, it is also possible to specify a local path and install the catalog from there.

.. option:: catalog

    The name of the catalog to be added.
    **It is a mandatory argument.**
    If the installation is done in editable mode, this name can be customized.

.. option:: --editable, -e <path>

    It installs the catalog based on the path given.
    It will create a symbolic link to the catalog folder.
    This is very recommended for developers. Please read the :ref:`dev-notes` section.

.. option:: --repository, -r <user/repo>

    It is possible to specify a different repository to explore.
    The format is ``user/repo``. For example, ``DestinE-Climate-DT/Climate-DT-catalog``.
    If this option is not specified, the default repository will be used.

.. warning::
    Adding a catalog not in editable mode makes use of GitHub API.
    These are limited to 60 requests per hour for unauthenticated users and it may easily hit the limit.
    If you encounter this issue, you can generate a personal access token and set it as an environment variable
    ``GITHUB_TOKEN``, together with a ``GITHUB_USER`` variable with your GitHub username.

.. _aqua-remove:

aqua remove <catalog>
---------------------

It removes a catalog from the list of available catalogs.
This means that the catalog folder will be removed from the installation folder or the link will be deleted
if the catalog is installed in editable mode.

.. option:: catalog

    The name of the catalog to be removed.
    **It is a mandatory argument.**

.. _aqua-set:

aqua set <catalog>
------------------

This command sets the default main catalog to be used.
Since it is possible to have multiple catalogs installed and accessible at the same time, 
if more than one catalog is present it will move the selected catalog to the top of the list.
The ``Reader`` behaviour will be then, if multiple triplets of ``model``, ``exp``, ``source`` are found in multiple
catalogs, to use the first one found in the selected catalog.

.. option:: catalog

    The name of the catalog to be set as default.
    **It is a mandatory argument.**

.. _aqua-uninstall:

aqua uninstall
--------------

This command removes the configuration and catalog files from the installation folder.
If the installation was done in editable mode, only the links will be removed.

.. note::
    If you need to reinstall aqua, the command ``aqua install`` will ask if you want to overwrite the existing files.

.. _aqua-list:

aqua list
---------

This command lists the available catalogs in the installation folder.
It will show also if a catalog is installed in editable mode.

.. option:: -a, -all

    This will show also all the fixes, grids and data models installed

.. _aqua-update:

aqua update
-----------

This command will update all the fixes, grids and various configuration files from the local copy of the AQUA repository. 
It is very useful if you pull a new version of AQUA and want to update your local confiugration and you are not in editable mode. 

.. option:: -c, --catalog

    This command will check if there is a new version of the catalog available and update it by overwriting the current installation.
    This will work only for catalogs installed from the Climate-DT repository.
    If the catalog is installed in editable mode, this command will not work.
    It is possible to specify 'all' as catalog name to update all the catalogs installed not in editable mode.


.. _aqua-fixes:

aqua fixes {add,remove} <fixes-file>
-------------------------------------

This submcommand is able to add or remove a fixes YAML file to the list of available installed fixes.
It will copy the fix file to the destination folder, or create a symbolic link if the editable mode is used.
This is useful if a new external fix is created and needs to be added to the list of available fixes.

.. option:: <fix-file>

    The path of the file to be added.
    This is a mandatory field.

.. option:: -e, --editable

    It will create a symbolic link to the fix folder. Valid only for ``aqua fixes add``

.. _aqua-grids:

aqua grids {add,remove} <grid-file>
-----------------------------------

This subcommand is able to add or remove a grids YAML file to the list of available installed grids.
It will copy the grids file to the destination folder, or create a symbolic link if the editable mode is used.
This is useful if new external grids are created and need to be added to the list of available grids.

.. option:: <grid-file>

    The path of the file to be added.
    This is a mandatory field.

.. option:: -e, --editable

    It will create a symbolic link to the grid folder. Valid only for ``aqua grids add``

aqua grids set <path>
---------------------

This subcommand sets in the configuration file the path to the grids, areas and weights folders.

.. option:: <path>

    The path to the grids, areas and weights folders.
    This is a mandatory field.
    The code will create the subfolders ``grids``, ``areas`` and ``weights`` in the specified path.

.. note::
    By default, if is not needed to set the path to the grids, areas and weights folders.
    AQUA will determine the path automatically based on the machine in the configuration file.
    This command is useful in new machines or if you don't have access to the default folders.

.. _aqua-grids-build:

aqua grids build
----------------

This subcommand is used to build grids from sources. Given a specific ``Reader()`` source, it tries to build a grid file based on the data available.
This is available for regular, healpix, curvilinear grids. Partial support for unstructured grids is also available, while gaussian grids are not supported yet.
It also create the correspondent grid entry in the grid file in the ``config/grids`` folder.

The following options are available for ``aqua grids build``:

.. option:: -c, --config <file>

    YAML configuration file for the builder. If not specified, options must be provided via CLI.

.. option:: --catalog <catalog>

    Catalog identifying the source for the Reader() call.

.. option:: -m, --model <model>

    Model name (e.g. "IFS") for the Reader() call. **(Required)**

.. option:: -e, --exp <experiment>

    Experiment name for the Reader() call. **(Required)**

.. option:: -s, --source <source>

    Data source for the Reader() call. **(Required)**

.. option:: -l, --loglevel <level>

    Log level for the builder. Default is WARNING.

.. option:: --rebuild

    Rebuild the grid even if it already exists.

.. option:: --version <version>

    Version number for the grid file. Currently integer versioning is supported. Useful for multiple versions of the same grid.

.. option:: --outdir <directory>

    Output directory for the grid file. Default is the current directory.

.. option:: --original <resolution>

    Original resolution of the grid. Useful for masked grids which have been remapped to a different resolution.

.. option:: --modelname <name>

    Alternative name for the model for grid naming. Useful for coupled models sources. 

.. option:: --gridname <name>

    Alternative name for the grid for grid naming. Required for Curvilinear and Unstructured grids, where the CDO grids cannot be guessed.

.. option:: --fix

    Fix the original source before building the grid. Useful for models with very specific coordinates/dimensions

.. option:: --verify

    Verify the grid file after creation. This is done by calling CDO via ``smmregrid`` to check if the weights generation is valid.

.. option:: --yaml

    Create the grid entry in the grid file after building. This has to be added to catalog `source_grid_name` manually to be used by the Reader.
    Please keep in mind that this is not verified yet. 


.. _aqua-drop:

aqua drop -c <config_file> <drop-options>
-----------------------------------------

This subcommand launch DROP (Data Reduction OPerator).
For full description of the DROP functionalities, please refer to the :ref:`drop` section.
In most of cases, it is better to embed this tool within a batch job.

.. _aqua-analysis:

aqua analysis <analysis-options>
--------------------------------

This subcommand launch the analysis tool, which is a flexible wrapper for the diagnostics.
It allows to run a set of diagnostics on a specific experiment.
For a complete description of the analysis tool, please refer to the :ref:`aqua_analysis` section.
