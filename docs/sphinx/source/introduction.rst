Overview of AQUA
----------------

AQUA (Climate DT Applications for QUality Assessment)
is a model evaluation framework designed for running diagnostics on high-resolution climate models,  
also known as Digital Twins of Earth.
The package provides a flexible and efficient framework to process and analyze large volumes of climate data. 
With its modular design, AQUA offers seamless integration of core functions and a wide range of diagnostic 
tools that can be run in parallel.

The main repository for AQUA is the `AQUA-core <https://github.com/DestinE-Climate-DT/AQUA>`_ repository.
The main repository for AQUA-diagnostics is the `AQUA-diagnostics <https://github.com/DestinE-Climate-DT/AQUA-diagnostics>`_ repository.

The AQUA-diagnostics repository contains the full set of diagnostic tools developed for the Destination Earth Adaptation Climate Digital Twin (ClimateDT).
It is designed to be used together with the AQUA core framework which provides data access and preprocessing functionalities.

Purpose
-------

The purpose of AQUA is to streamline the diagnostic process for high-resolution climate models, 
making it easier for researchers and scientists to analyze and interpret climate data. 
AQUA aims to provide a comprehensive toolkit for data preparation 
and running diagnostics on climate model outputs.

Key Features
------------

- Efficient handling of large datasets from high-resolution climate models
- Support for various data formats, such as GRIB, NetCDF, Zarr, FDB and Parquet access
- Robust and fast regridding functionality
- Averaging and aggregation tools for temporal and spatial analyses
- Metadata and coordinate fixes for data homogenization and comparison
- Modular design for easy integration of new diagnostics
- Lazy data access and parallel processing for faster execution of diagnostics, with limited memory usage
