Ensemble Diagnostic
===================

Description
-----------

In many areas of climate research, ensemble analysis is a standard approach to assess the robustness of model results and to quantify the uncertainty linked to numerical simulations.
By combining multiple simulations, whether from different models, parameter choices, or perturbed initial conditions, ensemble methods provide more reliable estimates of the behaviour of the system being studied.

The **Ensemble** diagnostic offers a set of tools to compute and visualise basic ensemble statistics, such as the mean and standard deviation.
These metrics help users examine both the typical response of the ensemble and the variability across its members, giving an indication of model agreement and the confidence that can be placed in the simulated fields.

It supports ensemble analysis for 1D time series, 2D ``LatLon`` maps, and zonal sections ``LevLon``, with the option to use weighted statistics for multi-model ensembles.


Classes
-------

There are three classes for the analysis:

* **EnsembleTimeseries**: computes ensemble mean and standard deviation for 1D time series data.
  It handles both monthly and annual data, computing statistics point-wise along the time axis.
  Results are saved as class attributes and as NetCDF files.

* **EnsembleLatLon**: computes ensemble mean and standard deviation for 2D latitude-longitude spatial maps.
  Results are saved as class attributes and as NetCDF files.

* **EnsembleZonal**: computes ensemble mean and standard deviation for zonal-mean level-latitude cross-sections.
  Results are saved as class attributes and as NetCDF files.

.. note::

The standard deviation is computed point-wise along the time axis.  
A reference time series can also be added to the plot.


There are three other classes for the plotting:

* **PlotEnsembleTimeseries**: provides methods for plotting time series with ensemble mean and ±2 standard deviation envelope.
  It supports adding a reference time series for comparison.

  * **PlotEnsembleLatLon**: provides methods for plotting spatial maps of ensemble mean and standard deviation.
  It generates separate maps for each statistic.

* **PlotEnsembleZonal**: provides methods for plotting zonal cross-sections of ensemble mean and standard deviation.


File structure
--------------

* The diagnostic is located in the ``aqua/diagnostics/ensemble`` directory, which contains both the source code and the command line interface (CLI) scripts.
* Template configuration files are available in the ``aqua/diagnostics/templates/diagnostics/`` directory.
* Notebooks are available in the ``notebooks/diagnostics/ensemble`` directory and contain examples of how to use the diagnostic.

Input variables and datasets
----------------------------

Before using the Ensemble diagnostic, a preprocessing step is required. Input data must be loaded and merged using the ``Reader`` class via  
``aqua.diagnostics.ensemble.util.reader_retrieve_and_merge``. The final merged dataset will contain all the requested ensemble members with appropriate metadata
Alternatively, data can be provided as a list of NetCDF file paths and merged with ``merge_from_data_files``. 

In this step, all available datasets, 1D timeseries, 2D latitude-longitude maps, and zonal-mean level-longitude fields, must be merged along a pseudo-dimension.  
By default, this dimension is named ``ensemble``, but it can be customised.

Data can be loaded directly as ``xarray.Dataset`` objects or through the AQUA  ``Reader`` class.

Example: loading and merging a 2D map ensemble into an ``xarray.Dataset``:

.. code-block:: python

   import glob
   from aqua.diagnostics import merge_from_data_files

   file_list = glob.glob(
       '/work/ab0995/a270260/pre_computed_aqua_analysis/*/historical-1990/atmglobalmean/netcdf/atmglobalmean.statistics_maps.2t.*_historical-1990.nc'
   )
   file_list.sort()

   ens_dataset = merge_from_data_files(
       variable='2t',
       model_names=['IFS-FESOM', 'IFS-NEMO'],
       data_path_list=file_list,
       log_level="WARNING",
       ens_dim="ensemble",
   )

Example: loading via the AQUA Reader

.. code-block:: python

   from aqua.diagnostics import reader_retrieve_and_merge

   ens_dataset = reader_retrieve_and_merge(
       variable='2t',
       catalog_list=['nextgems4', 'climatedt-phase1'],
       models_catalog_list=['IFS-FESOM', 'IFS-NEMO'],
       exps_catalog_list=['historical-1990', 'historical-1990'],
       sources_catalog_list=['aqua-atmglobalmean', 'aqua-atmglobalmean'],
       log_level="WARNING",
       ens_dim="ensemble",
   )

Some of the variables that are typically used in this diagnostic are:

* ``2t`` (2 metre temperature)
* ``tprate`` (total precipitation rate)
* ``msl`` (mean sea level pressure)
* ``so`` (sea water practical salinity)

Basic usage
-----------

The basic usage of this diagnostic is explained with a working example in the notebook. 
The basic structure of the analysis is the following:

The ensemble analysis is performed on merged ``1D`` timeseries by ``EnsembleTimeseries``, ``2D`` map by ``EnsembleLatLon``, and zonal ``Lev-Lon`` by ``EnsembleZonal`` classes.
Here is an example of how to use the ``EnsembleTimeseries`` class.

.. code-block:: python

    from aqua.diagnostics import EnsembleTimeseries, PlotEnsembleTimeseries

    ts = EnsembleTimeseries(
        var='2t',
        model_list=['IFS-FESOM', 'IFS-NEMO'],
        monthly_data=mon_model_dataset,
        annual_data=ann_model_dataset,
        outputdir='./',
        loglevel='WARNING',
    )

    ts.run()

    ts_plot = PlotEnsembleTimeseries(
        model_list=['IFS-FESOM', 'IFS-NEMO'],
        ref_model='ERA5',
        loglevel='WARNING',
    )

    ts_plot.plot(
        var='2t',
        monthly_data=ts.monthly_data,
        monthly_data_mean=ts.monthly_data_mean,
        monthly_data_std=ts.monthly_data_std,
        annual_data=ts.annual_data,
        annual_data_mean=ts.annual_data_mean,
        annual_data_std=ts.annual_data_std,
        ref_monthly_data=mon_ref_data,
        ref_annual_data=ann_ref_data,
    )

.. note::

    Start/end dates and reference dataset can be customized.
    If not specified otherwise, plots will be saved in PNG and PDF format in the current working directory. 

CLI usage
---------

The diagnostic can be run from the command line interface (CLI) by running the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd $AQUA/aqua/diagnostics/ensemble
    python cli_multi_model_timeseries_ensemble.py --config <path_to_config_file>

Other CLI scripts available:

* ``cli_single_model_timeseries_ensemble.py``: for single-model ensemble timeseries analysis
* ``cli_global_2D_ensemble.py``: for 2D latitude-longitude maps ensemble analysis

Additionally, the CLI can be run with the following optional arguments:

- ``--config``, ``-c``: Path to the configuration file.
- ``--nworkers``, ``-n``: Number of workers to use for parallel processing.
- ``--cluster``: Cluster to use for parallel processing. By default a local cluster is used.

Plots are saved in both PDF and PNG format.
Data outputs are saved as NetCDF files.


Configuration file structure

Most of the settings are common to all the diagnostics (see :ref:`diagnostics-configuration-files`).
Here we describe only the specific settings for the ensemble diagnostic.

* ``ensemble``: a block (nested in the ``diagnostics`` block) containing options for the Ensemble diagnostic.
  Variable-specific parameters override the defaults.
Most of the settings are common to all the diagnostics (see :ref:`diagnostics-configuration-files`).
Here we describe only the specific settings for the ensemble diagnostic.

    * ``run``: enable/disable the diagnostic.
    * ``diagnostic_name``: name of the diagnostic. ``ensemble`` by default.
    * ``variables``: list of variables to analyse.
