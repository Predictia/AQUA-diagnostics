ECmean4 Performance Metrics
===========================

`ECmean4 <https://pypi.org/project/ECmean4>`_ is an open source package which has been integrated within AQUA,
aiming at computing basic performance metrics. It specifically covers the Reichler and Kim Performance Indices (PIs)
and the so-called Global Mean (GMs), i.e. global averages for several fields compared againt observations.

Together, those numbers provides an estimates of the climate models climatological *skill* of some selected atmospheric and oceanic fields.

Description
-----------

The diagnostic computes two metrics. On the one hand, the `Reichler and Kim Performance Indices <https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/89/3/bams-89-3-303.xml>`_, usually known as PIs. 
are computed following the ECmean4 implementation: some minor differences from the original definition has been introduced,
so that the PIs are computed on a common (1x1 deg) grid rather than on the model grid.
From the original definition a few improvements has been introduced, using updated climatologies and provides the PIs also for a set of selected regions and seasons. 

From the formal point of view, PIs are computed as the root mean square error of a selected 2D field normalized by the
interannual variance estimated from the observations. Larger values implies worse performance (i.e. larger bias).
In the plots produced by ECmean4 implementation, PIs are normalized by the (precomputed) average of CMIP6 climate models,
so that number smaller than one implies a better performance than CMIP6 model.

On the other hand, the Global Mean (GMs) metric is computed. These are simply the average of many dynamical and physical fields which are 
compared against a set of pre-computed climatological values for both the atmosphere and the ocean (e.g. land temperature, salinity, etc.). 
Different observational datasets are taken in consideration for each variable, providing an estimate of the plausible variability in the form of interannual standard deviation.
GMs provides also estimate for the radiative budget  and for the hydrological cycle (including integrals over land and ocean) 
and other quantities useful for fast model assessment and for model tuning.

3D fields are zonally averaged, so that the PIs reports the performance on the zonal field.

For both diagnostics, if a variable (or more) is missing, blank line will be reported in the output figures. 

.. note ::
    ECmean4 is made to work with CMOR variables, but can handle name and file conversion with 
    specification of an `interface file <https://ecmean4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#interface-files>`_.
    An AQUA specific one has been designed for this purpose to work with Climate DT Phase 1. 
    Updates in the Data Governance will require updates to the interface file.  
    In addition, although PI and GM can work directly on the model raw output, the interface file 
    is made to work only with the Low Resolution Archive (LRA) data, generated by the AQUA Data Reduction 
    OPerator (DROP), to reduce the amount of computation required. 


Output 
------

The result are stored as a YAML file, indicating PIs and GMs for each variable, region and season, 
that can be stored for later evaluation.
Most importantly, a figure for GMs and a figure for PIs are produced showing a score card for the 
different regions, variables and seasons.
For the sake of simplicity, the PIs figure is computed as the ratio between the model PI and the 
average value estimated over the (precomputed) ensemble of CMIP6 models. 
Numbers lower than one imply that the model is performing better than the average of CMIP6 models. 

Similarly, the GMs are reported as a score card with the average of the field, together with observational value reported in a 
smaller font, and colorscale which tells how many standard deviations from the interannual variability the model is far from observation. 
The whiter the color, the more reliable is the model output.
