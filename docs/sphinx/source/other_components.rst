==========================

Time Statistics
---------------

Input data may not be available at the desired time frequency. It is possible to perform time statistics, including
time averaging, minimum, maximum and standard deviation at a given time frequency by using the ``Timstat()`` class and its method ``timstat()```
which allow for several statistical operations. The class is nested into the reader, and its method are exposed so that is sufficient
to use `timstat()` and its sibilings ``timmean()``, ``timmin()``, ``timmax()``, ``timsum()`` and ``timstd()``, as in the case below. 

.. code-block:: python

    reader = Reader(model="IFS", exp="tco2559-ng5", source="ICMGG_atm2d")
    data = reader.retrieve()
    daily = reader.timmean(data, freq='daily')
    # alternatively: daily = reader.timstat(data, stat='mean', freq='daily')

Data have now been averaged at the desired daily timescale. Similarly operations can be performed with others methods.

.. warning::
    If you do not specify the ``freq`` argument, the statistical operation will be operated on the entire dataset!

Some extra options are available:

- ``exclude_incomplete=True``: this flag will remove averaged chunks which are not complete
  (for example, verify  that all the record from each month are available before doing the time mean).
- ``center_time=True``: this flag will center the time coordinate on the mean time window. 
    Otherwise, the time coordinate will be the first timestamp of the time window.
- ``time_bounds=True``: this flag can be activated to build time bounds in a similar way to CMOR-like standard.

The ``timhist()``method is also available as a method of the ``Reader()`` class, passsing through the ``TimStat()`` 
class, so that it is easy to compute histograms on time-resampled data:

.. code-block:: python

    hist = reader.timhist(data['t2m'], freq="1D", bins=100, range=(250, 350), units='K')

or

.. code-block:: python

    hist = data['t2m'].aqua.timhist(freq="1D", bins=100, range=(250, 350), units='K')

When no time frequency information is provided, this method operates on the full time series, 
providing results identical to the ``histogram()`` method.
See the ``histogram()`` section below for more details on the available options.

Detrend
-------

For some analysis, computing or removing a linear (or polynominial) trend can be helpful to highlight the internal variability.
The ``detrend`` method can be used as a high-level wrapper of xarray polyfit functionalities to achieve this goal.

.. code-block:: python

    reader = Reader(model="IFS", exp="tco2559-ng5", source="ICMGG_atm2d")
    data = reader.retrieve()
    daily = reader.detrend(data['2t'], dim='time')

In this way, linear trend is removed from each grid point of the original dataset along the time dimension. 
Other dimension can be targeted too, although with limited physical meaning. 
Of course, it can be used in collaboration with temporal and spatial averaging. Higher order polynominial fits are available too.

Some options includes:

- ``degree``: this will define with an integer the order of the polynominial fit. Default is 1, i.e. linear detrending.
- ``skipna=True``: removing the NaN from the fit. Default is ``True``. 

.. warning::
    Trend and detrend might lead to incorrect results if there is not an equal amount of time elements (e.g. same amount of months or days) in the dataset.

It is also possible to evaluate the coefficients of the fit by calling the ``trender.coeffs()`` method.
This will call the ``coeffs()`` method of the ``Trender()`` class, which is used internally by the ``detrend()`` method.
A ``dataarray`` with the coefficients will be returned, with the same dimensions as the original data.

Spatial Selection
-----------------

The ``AreaSelection()`` class, part of the ``aqua.fldstat`` module, allows to select a specific region of the domain based on latitude and longitude limits.
The ``select_area()`` method can be used to perform the selection on a DataArray or Dataset.
It is possible to consider or drop the limits of the selection by setting the ``box_brd`` flag to ``True`` or ``False`` respectively.
It is also possible to drop the NaN values after the selection by setting the ``drop`` flag to ``True``.
The class is nested into the ``Reader()`` class, so it is possible to call the ``select_area()`` method directly from the reader instance or as aqua accessor.

.. note::
    When selecting a region that crosses the Greenwich meridian (e.g. lon_limits=[350, 10]),
    the method will automatically convert longitudes to the -180 to 180 range for the selection,
    in order to allow flawless plotting. The option can be disabled by setting the ``to_180`` flag to ``False``.

.. warning::
    In order to apply an area selection the data Xarray must include ``lon`` and ``lat`` as coordinates.
    It can work also on unstructured grids, but information on coordinates must be available.
    If the dataset does not include these coordinates, this can be achieved with the fixer
    described in the :ref:`fixer` section.

Spatial Statistics
------------------

The ``FldStat()`` class and its method ``fldstat()`` are used to do spatial operations and similary as for ``TimStat()`` does for time.
Statistical operations can be area-weighted if the class is initialiased with an xarray dataset containing the areas of the corresponding grid.
The class is nested into the ``Reader()``, which computes/load the areas of the corresponding source at the initialization.
Thus when calling for example ``reader.fldmean()`` method area-weighted spatial averaging will be performed.
The class ``FldStat()`` is nested into the reader, and its method are exposed so that is sufficient
to use ``fldstat(data, stat=statname)`` with `statname` being a string such as: ``mean``, ``min``, ``max``, ``sum``, ``std``, ``integral``, ``areasum``; 
Otherwise the relative sibilings can be called ``fldmean()``, ``fldmin()``, ``fldmax()``, ``fldsum()``, ``fldstd()``, ``fldintg()``, ``fldarea()``. 
For example, if we run the following commands:

.. code-block:: python

    reader = Reader(model="PSC", exp="PIOMAS", source="monthly", regrid="r100", loglevel='info')
    data = reader.retrieve()
    regrid_sithick = reader.regrid(data['sithick'])
    global_thick_mean = reader.fldmean(regrid_sithick)
    # alternatively: global_thick_mean = reader.fldstat(regrid_sithick, stat='mean')

we get a time series of the global average ``sithick``.

It is also possible to apply a regional section to the domain before performing the averaging.
This will internally use the ``AreaSelection()`` class described above.

.. code-block:: python

    tprate = data.tprate
    global_mean = reader.fldmean(tprate, lon_limits=[-50, 50], lat_limits=[-10,20])

.. warning::
    In order to apply an area selection the data Xarray must include ``lon`` and ``lat`` as coordinates.
    It can work also on unstructured grids, but information on coordinates must be available.
    If the dataset does not include these coordinates, this can be achieved with the fixer
    described in the :ref:`fixer` section.

    Also, if you do not specify the ``dims`` argument (e.g. `dims=['lon']`), the statistical operation will be operated on both 
    the (automatically found) horizontal dimensions of the dataset!

Histogram
---------

The ``histogram()`` function is a simple utility to compute histograms of input data, working with a Xarray DataArray in input.
The syntax is similar to the ``numpy.histogram()`` function, but it returns a DataArray with the histogram.
If the input DataArray is Dask-based then the computation will be lazy.
If a Dataset is passed, the first variable will be used.
Latitudinal weighting is activated by default, so the 'counts' of the histogram will not be integers.
It is possible to compute a complete PDF (Probability Density Function) by setting the ``density=True`` argument.

.. code-block:: python

    from aqua import histogram, Reader

    reader = Reader(model="IFS", exp="tco2559-ng5", source="ICMGG_atm2d")
    data = reader.retrieve()
    hist = histogram(data['t2m'], bins=100, range=(250, 350), units='K')
  
This will return a DataArray with the histogram of the ``t2m`` variable, with 100 bins ranging from 250 to 350,
with area weighting (on by default) after converting the units to 'K' (if needed)
In the output DataArray the ``center_of_bin`` and ``width`` coordinates contains the center and width of each bin respectively.
The ``bins`` and ``range`` arguments are recommended, all others totally optional.

Some extra options are available:

- ``weighted=False``: this will switch off computing a weighted histogram, where the weights are the cosines of the latitudes (true by default).
- ``density=True``: this will compute a PDF (Probability Density Function) instead of a histogram (false by default).
- ``dask=False``: this will force the computation of the histogram using numpy (true by default).
- ``check=True``: this will perform a test to verify that the sum of the counts is equal to the number of elements in the input data. 
                  It will fail if not appropriate bounds are used for the classes. Can be only used if the ``density`` flag is ``False``.
                  It will force a computation of the histogram and a numpy array will be returned.

The ``histogram()``method is also available as a method of the ``Reader()`` class, passsing through the ``TimStat()`` 
class, so that it is easy to compute histograms over the full dataset:
    
.. code-block:: python

    hist = reader.histogram(data['t2m'], bins=100, range=(250, 350))

or

.. code-block:: python

    hist = data['t2m'].aqua.histogram( bins=100, range=(250, 350))


.. _time-selection:

Time selection
--------------

Even if slicing your data after the ``retrieve()`` method is an easy task,
being able to perform a time selecetion during the Reader initialization
can speed up your code, having less metadata to explore.
For this reason ``startdate`` and ``enddate`` options are available both
during the Reader initialization and the ``retrieve()`` method to subselect
immediatly only a chunck of data.

.. note::
    If you're streaming data check the section :ref:`streaming` to have an
    overview of the behaviour of the Reader with these options.

.. _lev-selection:

Level selection
---------------

Similarly to :ref:`time-selection`, level selection is a trivial operation,
but when dealing with high-resolution 3D datasets, only ask for the
required levels can speed up the retrieve process.

When reading 3D data it is possible to specify already during ``retrieve()``
which levels to select using the ``level`` keyword.
The levels are specified in the same units as they are stored in the archive
(for example in hPa for atmospheric IFS data,
but an index for NEMO data in the FDB archive).

.. note::
    In the case of FDB data this presents the great advantage that a significantly reduced request will be read from the FDB 
    (by default all levels would be read for each timestep even if later a ``sel()`` or ``isel()`` selection
    is performed on the XArray).

.. warning::
    If you're dealing with level selection and regridding, please take a look at 
    the section :ref:`lev-selection-regrid`.

.. _streaming:

Streaming of data
-----------------

The Reader class includes the ability to simulate data streaming to retrieve chunks
of data of a specific time length.

Basic usage
^^^^^^^^^^^

To activate the streaming mode the user should specify the argument ``streaming=True``
in the Reader initialization.
The user can also choose the length of the data chunk with the ``aggregation`` keyword
(e.g. in pandas notation, or with aliases as ``daily``, ``monthly`` etc. or ``days``, ``months`` etc.).
The default is ``S`` (step), i.e. single saved timesteps are read at each iteration.
The user can also specify the desired initial and final dates with the keywords ``startdate`` and ``enddate``.

If, for example, we want to stream the data every three days from ``'2020-05-01'``, we need to call:

.. code-block:: python

    reader = Reader(model="IFS", exp= "tco2559-ng5", source="ICMGG_atm2d",
                    streaming=True, aggregation = '3D', startdate = '2020-05-01')    
    data = reader.retrieve()

The data available with the first retrieve will be only 3 days of the available times.
The ``retrieve()`` method can then be called multiple times,
returning a new chunk of 3 days of data, until all data are streamed.
The function will automatically determine the appropriate start and end points for each chunk based on
the internal state of the streaming process.

If we want to reset the state of the streaming process, we can call the ``reset_stream()`` method.


.. _accessors:

Accessors
---------

AQUA also provides a special ``aqua`` accessor to Xarray which allows
to call most functions and methods of the reader
class as if they were methods of a DataArray or Dataset.

Basic usage
^^^^^^^^^^^

Reader methods like ``reader.regrid()`` or functions like ``plot_single_map()``
can now also be accessed by appending the suffix ``aqua`` to a
DataArray or Dataset, followed by the function of interest,
like in ``data.aqua.regrid()``.

This means that instead of writing:

.. code-block:: python

    reader.fldmean(reader.timmean(data.tcc, freq="Y"))

we can write:

.. code-block:: python

    data.tcc.aqua.timmean(freq="Y").aqua.fldmean()

.. note::
    The accessor always assumes that the Reader instance to be used is either
    the one with which a Dataset was created or, for new derived objects and for **DataArrays of a Datasets**,
    the last instantiated Reader or the last use of the ``retrieve()`` method.
    This means that if more than one reader instance is used (for example to compare different datasets)
    we recommend not to use the accessor.

Usage with multiple Reader instances
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As an alternative the Reader class contains a special ``set_default()`` method which sets that reader
as an accessor default in the following.
The accessor itself also has a ``set_default()`` method
(accepting a reader instance as an argument) which sets the default and returns the same object.

Usage examples when multiple readers are used:

.. code-block:: python

    from aqua import Reader
    reader1=Reader(model="IFS", exp="test-tco79", source="short", regrid="r100")  # the default is now reader1
    reader2=Reader(model="IFS", exp="test-tco79", source="short", regrid="r200")  # the default is now reader2
    data1 = reader1.retrieve()  # the default is now reader1 
    data2 = reader2.retrieve()  # the default is now reader2
    reader1.set_default()  # the default is now reader1 
    data1r = data1.aqua.regrid()
    data2r = data2.aqua.regrid()  # data2 was created by retrieve(), so it remembers its default reader
    data2r = data2['2t'].aqua.set_default(reader2).aqua.regrid()  # the default is set to reader2 before using a method

Parallel Processing
-------------------

Since most of the objects in AQUA are based on ``xarray``, you can use parallel processing capabilities provided by 
``xarray`` through integration with ``dask`` to speed up the execution of data processing tasks.

For example, if you are working with AQUA interactively
in a Jupyter Notebook, you can start a dask cluster to parallelize your computations.

.. code-block:: python

    from dask.distributed import Client
    import dask
    dask.config.config.get('distributed').get('dashboard').update({'link':'{JUPYTERHUB_SERVICE_PREFIX}/proxy/{port}/status'})

    client = Client(n_workers=40, threads_per_worker=1, memory_limit='5GB')
    client

The above code will start a dask cluster with 40 workers and one thread per worker.

.. _data-provenance:

Data provenance
---------------

The implementation of data provenance is under development and only basic functionalities are available.
A set of metadata is stored as ``AQUA_metadata_name`` in the attributes of the ``xarray.Dataset`` retrieved by the ``Reader``.
The metadata includes information about the model, experiment, source and AQUA version used to retrieve the data.

Additionally the ``history`` attribute is updated with details of the operations performed on the data.
This is done by the ``Reader`` and it is under implementation for diagnostics as well.

A function ``log_history`` is available in the ``aqua.logger`` module to log in this attribute for a specific dataset.
This can be used as well to log the history of the operations performed on the data in custom scripts.
