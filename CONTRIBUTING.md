# Contributing guide

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow in AQUA-diagnostics, from opening an *issue*, creating a *Pull Request* (PR), reviewing, and merging the PR.

We welcome contributions to the AQUA-diagnostics project in many forms, and there's always plenty to do!

## Reporting issues

Before opening an issue, please [search the if the issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If it does, please add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

As a general rule, if you are unsure, please open an issue anyway and we will help you.
There is no automatic assignement of issues to anyone. If it is a bug, please fill all the cases and verify that reproducible code is reported. 
If you open a pull request to close some issues, please reference the issue it solves in the description.

### Reporting bugs

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by opening an issue in the AQUA-diagnostics repository. 
If you have a solution to it, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix. 
Please use the `bug` label for bugs issue and the `fix` label for Pull Requests with a fix.

When describing the bug, please include as much information as possible. This includes:
- short description of the bug
- steps to reproduce the bug
- catalog you are using
- machine you are using

## Pull Requests

The contribution workflow is based on Pull Requests (PR). 
A Pull Request is a request to merge a set of changes into the `main` branch of the repository. 
It is the main way to contribute to AQUA-diagnostics.

### Creating a Pull Request

Pull requests can be created directly in the AQUA-diagnostics repository, creating your own fork of the repository is not mandatory.

When creating a Pull Request, please make sure to:
- add a meaningful title and description
- reference the issue it solves in the description, if any
- start from the `main` branch if your Pull Request wants to be merged in the `main` branch
- point to the correct branch

If your Pull Request is adding some new dependencies, please make sure to state it in the description.

### Finalizing a Pull Request

If your Pull Request is a work in progress, please add `[WIP]` to the title.
When your Pull Request is ready to be reviewed, please remove `[WIP]` from the title. A label `run tests` can be added to the Pull Request to activate the CI tests.
A label `ready to merge` can be added to the Pull Request to indicate that it is ready to be reviewed and hopefully merged in the opinion of the author. 

Before asking for a review, please make sure to:
- be up to date with the `main` branch
- run the tests successfully
- if a new dependency has been added to the framework, please make sure to update the `environment.yml` and `pyproject.toml` files
- please notice that a lumi_install.sh script is available to install the framework on a LUMI machine.
  It is located in the `cli/lumi-install` folder.
  If the environment has been modified, please make sure to update the files `environment_lumi.yml` and `pip_lumi.txt` accordingly.
- if a new feature has been added, please make sure to update the documentation accordingly
- add docstrings to your code
- remove any file unrelated to your Pull Request

Do not merge your Pull Request yourself, it will be merged by the AQUA-diagnostics team.

### Suggesting enhancements

Enhancements of existing features or new features may be suggested by opening an issue in the AQUA-diagnostics repository. Please use the `improvements` label for existing features and the `enhancement` label for new features.

### Coding style

Please follow the [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) coding style.
We use Flake8 to check the coding style, with a length limit of 127 characters per line.
We run the Flake8 check with the following command:

```bash
flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82
